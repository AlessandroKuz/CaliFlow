TLDR:
    1. Create the muscle_group class and exercise class
    2. Create the skill class and progressions class
    3. Create the user class and workout class
    4. Create the warmup, cooldown, and stretching classes
    5. Create the script logic for choosing exercises, rest time, inputting reps and sets, and storing data in a file or db
    6. Create the GUI using tkinter
    7. Create the databases for storing exercises and user data
    8. Create a logo and choose a color palette and style for the app, and brainstorm other names


Main:
    Script:
        -Create a "list" that has all main muscle groups/domains and for each one a "list" of exercises and then same for each skills (levers, unilateral exercises, etc)
        -Create the logic that allows you to choose the exercises, rest time and lets you input reps and sets -> store the data in a file or db
        -Create a GUI (probably in tkinter for now and then explore alternatives)
        Later:
            -Create a ML script that returns a % of the quality of each rep

    GUI:
        -Create a GUI (probably in tkinter for now and then explore alternatives)

    Database:
        -Create a database to store the exercises data
        -Create a database to store the user data

    Style & App:
        -Create a logo
        -Brainstorm other names(?)
        -Choose a color palette a style for the app

    Code:
        -Create a muscle_group class (name, muscle group)
        -Create an exercise class (name, muscle, difficulty, etc)
        -Create a skill class (name, description, etc)
        -Create a progressions class (name, description, difficulty, etc)
        -Create a user class (name, age, weight, height, etc)
        -Create a (default | modular)workout class (name, description, difficulty, etc)
        -Create a warmup class (name, description, time, muscle groups, etc)
        -Create a cooldown class (name, description, time, muscle groups, etc)
        -Create a stretching class (name, description, time, muscle groups, etc)
        -Write a main function with other subfunctions that allow you to choose the exercises, rest time and lets you input reps and sets -> store the data in a file or db


Future implementations:
    
    Way off:
        -VR implementation: 
            -VR explanations with demonstration of the exercises
            -Third person view to see wheter you are doing the exercise correctly -> ML script to return a % of the quality of each rep
            -VR Environment like mountains, beach and so on...
