TLDR:
    1. Create the Exercises+ and children classes (muscle groups, exercise | skill, progressions)
    2. Create the user class and workout class
    3. Create the warmup, cooldown, and stretching classes
    4. Create the script logic for choosing exercises, rest time, inputting reps and sets
    5. Create the GUI using tkinter -> explore alternatives
    6. Create a logo and choose a color palette and style for the app, and brainstorm other names

Future:
    (-Create the databases for storing exercises and user data -> scale it to a server)
    (-Create a ML script that returns a % of the quality of each rep)
    (-Modular workout class)

-Keep track of what type of muscles are trained per workout, then do a sum per (week|month|year) -> heatmap of trained areas & graph of the progression of each muscle group
-Implement a section of data analysis and vizualization

(((Future implementations:    
    Way off:
        -VR implementation: 
            -VR explanations with demonstration of the exercises
            -Third person view to see wheter you are doing the exercise correctly -> ML script to return a % of the quality of each rep
            -VR Environment like mountains, beach and so on...)))
